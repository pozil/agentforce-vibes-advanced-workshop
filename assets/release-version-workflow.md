# Release Version Workflow

## Assumptions

- This workflow applies to the current repository.
- The following software is installed
   - git CLI (`git`)
   - GitHub CLI (`gh`)
   - JQ command-line JSON processor (`jq`)
- All repository versions use Semantic Versioning convention.

## Instructions

1. **Check for local repository changes**

   Make sure that there are no local changes to the git repository and that everything has been pushed with this command:

   ```sh
   git status
   ```

   If there are any untracked or uncommitted changes, abort the workflow regardless of the changes' type.

2. **Get remote repository's latest release**

   Retrieve the latest released version of the repository with this command:

   ```sh
   PAGER= gh release list --json tagName,isLatest --jq '.[] | select(.isLatest)|.tagName'
   ```

3. **Get local project's version**

   Get the local `version` value from the `package.json` file.

4. **Determine new version**

   If the local version is smaller or identical to the remote version, ask for the new release's type before proceeding: major, minor or patch.
   Based on the release type, determine the new release version (`RELEASE_VERSION`) by following semantic versioning.

5. **Determine release title**

   Ask the user for the new release's title (`RELEASE_TITLE`).

6. **Increase local project version**

   Update the `package.json` file with the new version.
   Commit and push the change.

7. **Create GitHub release**

   Create the GitHub release with this command (replace `RELEASE_VERSION` and `RELEASE_TITLE` with the previously collected values):

   ```sh
   gh release create RELEASE_VERSION --title RELEASE_TITLE --generate-notes
   ```
